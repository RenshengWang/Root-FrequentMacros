# Root-FrequentMacros
Some useful macros of ROOT when we do the data analysis.
CERN ROOT is too useful when we do the data analysis of high energy and nuclear physics. Different people will has different custom, and different task. So for a more general purpose, Root is designed to be a general powerful tool. Here I only record some of my macros, which is always used when I do the data analysis.
1, rootlogin.C : which will be executed automatically. So you can set the environment parameters, draw style, load classes. 
2, some very frequent command, but I always forget~~
3, Standard class template, which can be compliled and loaded into root.
4, Some of my experience when I use the root.
